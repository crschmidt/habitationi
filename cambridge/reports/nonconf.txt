Based on the automated assessment of nonconforming parcel status, we can
evaluate each lot based on it conforming with a lenient definition of zoning,
including FAR, open space, units per lot area, and the least restrictive
setback dimension. This will not provide a full evaluation of zoning, but
it gives a good appromxation. Here we include an example SQL query against
the data that shows the nonconforming percentage in each of the primarily
residential districts in the city.

select zone, nonconf as nonconforming, count(*) as lots, sum(units) as units from lots where zone in ('A-1', 'A-2', 'B', 'C', 'C-1') group by 1, 2 order by 1, 2;

zone,nonconforming,lots,units
